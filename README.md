## Wordle
[Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) is a fun puzzle game where each day you are given a singular 5 letter word in the English langauge and your goal is to guess the word in 6 attempts. There will be feedback given for each attempt such as (B)lack, (Y)ellow, and (G)reen. Each color means a different thing:
- Black means the letter is not in the word at all
- Yellow means the letter is in the word but not in that position
- Green means the letter is in the word and in the right position.

**Example of me playing Wordle**:

*[Wordle Unlimited](https://www.wordleunlimited.com/) allows you to play an unlimited amount of wordle games per day rather than just once per day!*


### Artificial Intelligence Algorithms:

- **Filtering**: <br>
Based on the given feedback the algorithm will filter all possible words until the feedback says the word is correct! Here is the [English Dictionary Used](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb-words.txt) with this algorithm.
